        <h2>What is this game?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Track the Word</strong> is a music-based lyric game that
          challenges you to find a song containing a specific word. Whether
          you're playing solo, with a friend, or competitively, the game makes
          song-based challenges fast and fun! ddd
        </p>
        <p>
          This idea was inspired by Hayford's workplace game, where coworkers
          tried to name songs based on random words. However, checking lyrics
          manually slowed things down. <strong>Track the Word</strong> automates
          that process with smart tech, verifying songs instantly using lyrics
          databases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to keep the game dynamic, exciting, and competitive by
          removing delays and boosting the fun.

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Track the Word</strong> is a lyric-based guessing game powered
          by automation. The game‚Äôs backend will use Python (Django or Flask) to
          handle API calls and store results in a MySQL database, while the
          frontend will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or React for expanded
          functionality).
        </p>
        <p>
          Our chosen API is <strong>Vagalume</strong>, known for providing
          reliable lyric and song metadata. This enables the game to validate
          player submissions instantly, keeping the gameplay snappy and reducing
          downtime.
